Theme administration allow you to edit the content which is present on every pages of your site like the footer.

#### Content administration ####

![Page edition](https://raw.github.com/prestaconcept/prestacms-sandbox/master/app/Resources/docs/assets/backend-page-edit.jpg)

Each page can have a different template on which you can add as many block as you need.

Thanks to a generic block system easily extendable, your pages can render eaverything you need.

## Installing PrestaCMS Sandbox ##

### Get the code ###

As Symfony uses [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) to manage its dependencies, the recommended way to create a new project is to use it.

If you don't have Composer yet, download it following the instructions on http://getcomposer.org/ or just run the following command:

    curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php

Then, use the `create-project` command to generate a new Symfony application:

    php composer.phar create-project presta/cms-sandbox path/to/install/prestacms-sandbox -s dev

Composer will install Symfony and all its dependencies under the `path/to/install` directory.

### Create the database ###

Sandbox is configured to work on SQLite. Database file will be create it app/database/app.sqlite.

    app/console doctrine:database:create
    app/console doctrine:schema:create
    chmod 777 app/database app/logs app/cache
    chmod 777 app/database/*
    app/console doctrine:phpcr:init:dbal
    app/console doctrine:phpcr:register-system-node-types
    app/console doctrine:phpcr:fixtures:load --no-interaction

If you have 'make' installed on your machine, you can use the install command

    make install

:speech_balloon: : if you have a permission denied error, you just need to add the execution right on your console

    chmod +x app/console

the [cmf-sandbox set-up](https://github.com/symfony-cmf/cmf-sandbox)

### Virtual host ###

As PrestaCMS depends on host configuration, you have to set up virtual hosts for the sandbox.

**/etc/hosts**

    127.0.0.1 sandbox.prestacms.com.local
    127.0.0.1 sandbox.prestacms.fr.local

**vhosts.conf**

    #PrestaCMS Sandbox
    <VirtualHost 127.0.0.1:80>
        DocumentRoot /home/nbastien/www/prestaconcept/prestacms-sandbox/web

        Servername sandbox.prestacms.com.local
        Serveralias sandbox.prestacms.fr.local

        ErrorLog "/var/log/apache2/prestacms-sandbox-error.log"
        CustomLog "/var/log/apache2/prestacms-sandbox-access.log" common

        <Directory />
            Options FollowSymLinks
            AllowOverride None
        </Directory>

        <Directory /home/nbastien/www/prestaconcept/prestacms-sandbox/web>
            Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
            AllowOverride All
            Order allow,deny
            allow from all
        </Directory>
    </VirtualHost>
